## What does it do?

This code retrieves data from the Nobel Prize Winners web API and transforms it into readable information. The page displays all laureates that won more than one Nobel Prize. I tried following the principles of [Functional Programming](https://github.com/christiaanbraun/functional-programming/wiki/Functional-Programming) as much as I could. This means some functions are reusable but others aren't.
